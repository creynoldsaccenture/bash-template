#Bash/Linux and Sublime text docs

##Requirements 

This template will need the following programs installed on your machine to run properly:

1. Git (duh!)
2. Node.js
3. Ruby (including the Sass gem)

##Installation
1. `git clone` this repository.
2. `cd` into the repository folder and run `npm install` to install node dependencies.
3. Once the dependencies have finished installing, run `grunt` and wait for it to finish building the template.
4. Once the template has been built, open a bash/cmd prompt and run `node server.js`.
5. Navigate your browser to http://127.0.0.1:3000.

##Usage
This template includes two grunt tasks:

1. `grunt`
2. `grunt prod`

`grunt` will run the tasks in development mode. This means that the CSS and Javascript files will not be minfied.

`grunt prod` will run the tasks in prodution mode. This will minify all CSS and Javascript files.

Once the `grunt` tasks have executed in dev mode the bash/cmd prompt should show the following output:
```
Running "clean:dist" (clean) task
>> 1 path cleaned.

Running "sass:dev" (sass) task

Running "autoprefixer:files" (autoprefixer) task
File dist/styles/main.css created.
File dist/styles/main.css.map created (source map).

Running "concat:dev" (concat) task
File dist/js/main.js created.

Running "copy:images" (copy) task


Running "copy:tbsfonts" (copy) task
Copied 5 files

Running "watch" task
Waiting...
```
The `Running "watch" task` part means that Grunt is watching the Sass (scss) and Javascript (js) files to see if they are modified. For example, if you changed anything in `app.scss` then Grunt will re-run the `sass:dev` task.

*N.B. `grunt prod` will not watch assets for changes.*

##Configuration
Custom grunt tasks can be added as JSON config in `Gruntfile.js`.

To install new dependencies run `npm install <package name> --save-dev`. The `--save-dev` flag tells npm to update the `packages.json` file with the new dependency.

The IP address and port of the Express server can be changed by modifying the following line in `server.js`:
```
var server = app.listen(3000, '127.0.0.1', function () {
```
For example if you're on a linux machine:
```
var server = app.listen(1337, '0.0.0.0', function () {
```
This will run the server at http://0.0.0.0:1337.

##Troubleshooting

If you see the following message:

```
grunt-cli: The grunt command line interface. (v0.1.13)

Fatal error: Unable to find local grunt.

If you're seeing this message, either a Gruntfile wasn't found or grunt
hasn't been installed locally to your project. For more information about
installing and configuring grunt, please see the Getting Started guide:

http://gruntjs.com/getting-started
```
Then Grunt is not installed. To install Grunt run `npm install grunt` and `npm install grunt-cli`.

If you run `grunt` and see something similar to the following message:

```
Running "sass:dev" (sass) task

Then the Ruby Sass gem is not installed. To install the gem run `gem install sass` (depending on how fast your machine is, this might take a while).
